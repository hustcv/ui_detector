# Requirement
1. [sip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SIP)
2. [PyQt4](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download)

# Usage
1. git clone [insulator](git clone https://github.com/DuinoDu/insulator) to py-faster-rcnn
2. Since this code is based on [tools/demo.py](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn/blob/master/tools/demo.py), you need to add some code to $py-faster-rcnn-PATH/tools/demo.py. The code you need to add is in [ui.py](https://github.com/DuinoDu/insulator/blob/master/ui.py) comment.
3. Run it with *python ui.py*
